Specifically not a framework. A minimal approach and tutorial for module loading, templating, and one-way data binding (flux).

No bundlers, libs, or frameworks. No webpack, jQuery, React, lodash, etc. Mostly just an experiment to see how popular JavaScript patterns can be replicated in vanilla JavaScript.
